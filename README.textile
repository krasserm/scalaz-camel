This project provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for "Apache Camel":http://camel.apache.org/ that is based on the "Scala":http://www.scala-lang.org/ programming language and the "Scalaz":http://code.google.com/p/scalaz/ library. It supports the combination of message processors and endpoints to complete message processing routes based on functional programming (FP) concepts such continuations, monads and Kleisli composition.

The scalaz-camel DSL is an alternative to Camel's existing Java DSL and Scala DSL. It strongly focuses on Scala and Scalaz idioms when constructing integration solutions from "enterprise integration patterns":http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/ (EIPs) with Apache Camel. The DSL was re-designed from scratch with the goal of a better and more native integration with the Scala programming language.
