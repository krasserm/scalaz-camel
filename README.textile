This project provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for "Apache Camel":http://camel.apache.org/ that is based on the "Scala":http://www.scala-lang.org/ programming language and the "Scalaz":http://code.google.com/p/scalaz/ library. It is an alternative to Camel's existing Java DSL and Scala DSL and allows for an easier application of functional programming concepts and Scala(z) idioms in message processing routes. *Please note that the project is still in a very early stage and the DSL is subject to change*.
